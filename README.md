VR920-JNI-Library
=================

This library provides support for Java applications to use the VR920's native C++ API

NOTE: Currently this only works on Windows... I haven't found a way to add support on mac just yet, best bet may be to use something like openFrameworks or Cinder and the native framework instead.
